# Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 6
## Basic Workflow Tutorial

##### In this chapter, we will go through the Lightroom 6 basic photo-editing process and explore additional tools for refinement in Photoshop CS6.

##### Instructions:

Required programs: Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 6; Adobe Photoshop CS6 or CC

First, download the sample RAW image at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nml6cou22azbjic/_MG_9015.CR2?dl=0

Open the RAW image in Lightroom from your "Downloads" folder by right-clicking the file and selecting the "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom" application in the _Open With_ menu.

Upon opening the file in Lightroom, you will be prompted with options for your photo import. Just select our sample RAW image and click __Import__.

After importing, go to the "Develop" tab in the top-right corner. You may have to reselect the thumbnail of the image we're working on in the bottom slider menu.

After this point, every step you take is your own! Feel free to get creative — we're just providing the guidelines.

Begin with cropping and adjusting the angle of the photo. The crop tool is in the top left of the tool bar on the right. Level guidelines are overlayed to help with the tilt — though in this case, the image seems to already be level.

Once you've decided upon the canvas you want to work with, move onto editing the image itself. Select the most accurate white-balance option, then adjust the exposure, or brightness, of the image until you see fit. Attempt to find the most balanced point of exposure — we can always adjust highlights and shadows after. 

After deciding upon an exposure, adjust the contrast. Contrast is the scale of difference between black and white in your image. RAW images assume a neutral contrast level, so increasing the contrast level to around +15 is a safe start. Make sure to pay attention to how adjusting contrast affects the highlights and shadows of the image.

Next, we move onto the "Tone" section: highlights, shadows, whites, and blacks. Highlights and whites are similar, in that they are both the brighter part of the image. However, the "highlights" adjustment affects the levels of the brighter parts of the image without affecting the shade of white, while the "whites" adjustment is meant specifically for adjusting the image's shade of white as desired. With the "highlights" slider, you can choose to emphasize the lighter parts of the image by increasing highlight levels, or emphasize the detail within the highlights by decreasing the levels. The "shadows" slider can also be adjusted to reveal detail; try increasing shadows levels by +20 just to test it out. Meanwhile, the "blacks" slider can be adjusted to either lighten the darkest parts of the image, or to further darken the darkest parts to increase contrast — it all depends on the image and the editor. In this case, the tone of white is rather dark for the gazebo, so it seems like a good idea to increase the "white" level about +8. Shadows could be brightened to allow for more background detail, or darkened to draw attention to the gazebo. Highlights should be adjusted with a balance of gazebo detail and background coast detail in mind. But, as we said before, it's your masterpiece!

After "Tone," we should check out "Presence." This includes clarity, vibrance, and saturation. Clarity affects the details of the midtones — increasing clarity increases detail and adds definition to the image. Saturation and vibrance are similar in that they both affect the brightness and depth of colors, but they have a crucial difference. While "saturation" affects all pixels in an image, "vibrance" is more particular; it only saturates the less-saturated parts of the image, allowing for a more balanced addition of color. With these tools, you will be able to get your image's presence exactly as you want it!

Next, we're gonna tackle the Tone Curve. First, select the point curve as you see fit. Pay attention to the contrast being added, and how it affects the visibility of details. Once you've chosen a point curve to begin with, you can tweak the highlights, lights, darks, and shadows sliders as you see fit. 

The HSL/Color/B&W tab affects the color values and specific color saturations of the image. In this case, we are editing a photo with color, so only the "HSL" and "Color" tabs are relevant. Under the "HSL" tab, you can use the sliders to adjust individual colors' hue, saturation, and luminance. Under the "Color" tab, the same options are presented, just in a different format. On the other hand, if you want the photo to be black & white, only the "B&W" tab would be relevant. Under the B&W tab, you can adjust individual colors' values in the spectrum between black & white.

Following these adjustments, we move onto "Split Toning." Split toning is the application of tinting to highlights and shadows. This tool often allows us to achieve a level of color depth that is otherwise unattainable, despite its artificial nature. Try selecting a shade of light blue for the highlights, and a darker green for shadows, in order to make the image pop more. But don't feel restricted to these changes! Split toning is absolutely at the artists' discretion — so, explore your options!

The "Detail" tab allows for adjustments of sharpness and noise reduction. When adjusting sharpness, use the small crosshair icon in the top left of the tab to select the part of the image which you'd like to preview changes in — details are key, especially when sharpening. The noise reduction tool is made possible through luminance adjustments, which hide the grainy "noise" that usually results from the camera's ISO being set too high. After adjusting luminance, you can adjust the detail and contrast as best suits the image.

The "Lens Corrections" tab uses the Lightroom software to fix the distortion and vignetting that is inherent to camera bodies and lenses. You can either select your lens profile from a list of presets, or correct manually. This tab helps present the image as it actually appears in real life.

Finally, there is the "Effects" tab.
