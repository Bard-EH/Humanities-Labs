Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 6
- _Basic Workflow Tutorial_

# __In this chapter, we will go through the Lightroom 6 basic photo-editing process and explore additional tools for refinement in Photoshop CS6.__
## 

### **Instructions:**

Required programs: Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 6; Adobe Photoshop CS6 or CC

First, download the sample RAW image at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nml6cou22azbjic/_MG_9015.CR2?dl=0

Open the RAW image in Lightroom from your "Downloads" folder by right-clicking the file and selecting the "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom" application in the _Open With_ menu.

Upon opening the file in Lightroom, you will be prompted with options for your photo import. Just select our sample RAW image and click __Import__.

After importing, go to the "Develop" tab in the top-right corner. You may have to reselect the thumbnail of the image we're working on in the bottom slider menu.

Begin with cropping and adjusting the angle of the photo. The crop tool is in the top left of the tool bar on the right. Level guidelines are overlayed to help with the tilt — though in this case, the image seems to already be level.

Once you've decided upon the canvas you want to work with, move onto editing the image itself. Select the most accurate white-balance option, then adjust the brightness of the image until you see fit. Attempt to find a balanced point of exposure — we can always adjust highlights and shadows after.
