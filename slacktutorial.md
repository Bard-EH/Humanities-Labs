Slack Tutorial

Slack is an application designed for digital team communication. Communication is broken down into three categories: channels, private channels, and direct messages. While regular channels are visible to the entire team, you can choose who participates in private channels. Meanwhile, direct messages offer a private method of communicating individually.
Communication is not limited to messaging! You can drag and drop any files from your computer into a channel, private channel, or direct message.
