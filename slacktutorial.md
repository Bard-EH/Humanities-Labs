# Slack Tutorial

Slack is an application designed for digital team communication. Communication is broken down into three categories: channels, private channels, and direct messages. While regular channels are visible to the entire team, you can choose who participates in private channels. Meanwhile, direct messages offer a private method of communicating individually.
Team communication on Slack is not limited to merely text messages! You can drag and drop any files from your computer into a channel, private channel, or direct message.

To begin this tutorial, download the Slack application for your device at https://slack.com/downloads. Upon entering the application, you will be prompted for a Slack URL.

Enter https://bardtutorial.slack.com/signup and then enter your Bard email address to register for the example team.

Once you have entered, explore and familiarize yourself with the user interface. The sidebar contains shortcuts to your channels, as well as your fellow team members to direct message.

In this case, your team members will be anyone who has signed up for this tutorial before. As you navigate the sidebar, check out the plus signs next to the Channels and Direct Messages headings. By clicking on these, you can start a new channel or direct message as you desire. Try creating a new channel!

Once you've created a new channel, experiment with uploading multimedia into Slack. You can drag & drop files, copy & paste files, or click the plus sign pictured below and select "Upload." Slack makes it easy to share what you need.

The search function in Slack is extremely helpful, especially once a large amount of communication has transpired. You can use search modifiers to make this search function even more helpful. Search modifiers are broken down into three categories: for conversation, for time, and for properties. Conversation search modifiers include searching for messages from a specific team member, searching for messages sent to a specific channel or direct message, and searching for messages in a specific channel or direct message.

Finally, navigate to the sidebar again and click on the team name, "Bard Slack Tutorial." A drop-down menu will appear offering a variety of options. Under the "You" heading, check out your preferences. You can adjust your settings for essentially everything you could possibly desire, including notifications, media, and the search function. Then, under the "You" heading again, select "View Profile & Account" and click on "Edit" to adjust your name, profile picture, and contact information. After that, you're set to succeed in Slack!
