# Slack Tutorial

Slack is an application designed for digital team communication. Communication is broken down into three categories: channels, private channels, and direct messages. While regular channels are visible to the entire team, you can choose who participates in private channels. Meanwhile, direct messages offer a private method of communicating individually.
Team communication on Slack is not limited to merely text messages! You can drag and drop any files from your computer into a channel, private channel, or direct message.

To begin this tutorial, download the Slack application for your device at https://slack.com/downloads. Upon entering the application, you will be prompted for a Slack URL. Enter https://bardtutorial.slack.com/signup and then enter your Bard email address to join the example team.

Once you have entered, explore and familiarize yourself with the user interface. The sidebar contains shortcuts to your channels, as well as team members to direct message.
