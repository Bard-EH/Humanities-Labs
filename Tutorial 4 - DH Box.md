<h1>DH Box</h1>
<p>"DH Box is a laboratory in the cloud that can be deployed quickly and easily. 
It's simply accessed from any computer as long as you've got an internet connection and some contextual knowledge."</p>
<p>DH Box is a tool for those in or interested in the digital humanities, but it's much more than that.</p>
<p>"Ready-to-go configurations of Omeka, NLTK, IPython, R Studio, and Mallet are included in the DH Box platform. 
Through this praxis friendly environment, professors and students have instant classroom access to a cadre of gold-standard DH tools.
Professors will be able to launch a DH computer lab in just a few minutes."</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<h4>Initial Setup:</h4>
<p>First you'll want to go to <a href="http://dhbox.org/">DHBox.org</a>.</p>
<p>There, you should see this:</p>

<p>It may take a moment to build, but congratulations! You've just made your own DH Box!</p>
<p>Once inside, you'll see the following options:</p>

<p>If you click on "Command Line," you'll be prompted to enter a username and password. These will be the ones you set earlier when you created your account.</p>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>Now, you have access to a fully featured command line! For more documentation on how to use it, I recommend <a href="https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line">The Art of Command Line</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/Bash-shell">DH Box's own documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Next on our list of DH Box tools is R Studio, a fully featured user interface for R. Learn more <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/home/">here</a>.</p>
<p>After clicking on the "R Studio" button, you should be taken here:</p>

<p>Note that your login credentials are the same here as they are for your DH Box.</p>
<p>You'll then be taken into R Studio. To learn more about R, I recommend <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/">TutorialsPoint</a>. It should give you the necessary basics to get started.</p>
<p>Then there's Omeka. It's "a free, flexible, and open source web-publishing platform for the display of library, museum, archives, and scholarly collections and exhibitions."</p>
<p>Click the button, and login with your DH Box credentials.</p>

<p>I recommend you read up on <a href="https://github.com/DH-Box/dhbox/wiki/Omeka">DH Box's Omeka Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Brackets is "A modern, open source text editor that understands web design." it doesn't require a a username or password and you can learn more about it at <a href="http://brackets.io/">the official website</a>.</p>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook is "a web application for interactive data science and scientific computing." You can read up about them <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">here</a>.</p>
<p>When you click the "Jupyter Notebooks" button, you will be prompted to input your DH Box password:</p>

<p>Then, to create a new notebook, click "new" and select your language from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>The final tool in our DH Box toolkit is Wordpress: it's "a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability." Learn more about it on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress.org</a>. Click the Wordpress button in DH Box to get started.</p>
<p>You'll be taken to a language selection screen. I'll be using English but Wordpress supports many more than that.</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RlpStiL.png" alt="Wordpress Languages">
<p>After that, you'll be prompted for several things: a site title, username, password, email address, and whether you want search engines to index your site or not. Fill in your settings and click "Install Wordpress."</p>

<p>Congratulations! You're on your way to becoming a DH Box expert!</p>
<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
