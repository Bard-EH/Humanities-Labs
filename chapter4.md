#Tweet Archiver
<p>Twitter encapsulates a vast amount of data from around the globe (and beyond it).<p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.labnol.org/about/">Amit Agarwal</a>, this data is now at our fingertips.<p>
<p>From his <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/save-twitter-hashtag-tweets/6505/">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.labnol.org/internet/save-twitter-hashtag-tweets/6505/">
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if Twitter had an Export button? You search for a trending #hashtag, or an old tweet, or your brand name, and all the matching tweets get saved in an Excel or Google spreadsheet. And this archive would just update itself in the background as new tweets arrive.

<p>Well, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-archiver/pkanpfekacaojdncfgbjadedbggbbphi">Twitter Archiver</a> makes this possible.</p>
<p>This tutorial will serve as a basic introduction to the tool as well as a potential use for the data collected.</p>
<p>After installing Twitter Archiver, the first step is to make a new Google spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Once that's done, go to Add-ons -> Twitter Archiver -> Authorize Twitter </p>

<p>Next, you will be prompted to create a search rule.</p>

<p>As soon as you've decided on a phrase, hashtag, or user, click "Start Tracking" and begin populating your spreadsheet. You may see a box in the bottom right of your screen, but it should disappear after the initial twitter scraping is done.</p>

<p>Then you will have a complete spreadsheet containing dates of tweets, user screen names, user full names, tweet content, as well as several other pieces of data pertaining to each individual tweet.</p>

<p>Luckily, the Google spreadsheet can then be exported for Excel or as a CSV.</p>
<p>"Why would I want to do that?" you may ask yourself, but there are more interesting questions to be asked:</p>
<p>Where do these tweets come from?</p>
<p>What kinds of topics make tweets popular?</p>
<p>How do Twitter users describe themselves?</p>
<p>For this tutorial, we'll aim to answer the following question:</p>
<p>"What influence do followers have on retweets and favorites?"</p>
<p>It would be possible to go through the spreadsheet we generated and individually draw comparisons, but no single human should have the capacity to make any significant judgments from this data alone.</p>
<p>Thus, we will graph it.</p>
